# Works-On-CPP

Two of my school CPP projects with file system and data handling.

### Bank Management Application (Project on Grade 12)
It is a bank management system with data file handling and is designed with flexible options like account creation, money deposit and withdrawal, and balance viewing. Administrators have a separate login with additional privileges.

### Hotel Billing Application (Project on Grade 11)
It is a billing and invoicing system with minimum viable options.
